To calculate the Calcium Phosphate Product and analyze the trends, I will use the following data from the search results:

Corrected Calcium (mmol/L):
1: 2.21
5: 2.1  
8: 2.05
10: 2.16
13: 2.14
14: 2.14

Phosphate (Pre Dialysis) (mmol/L):
1: 0.97
5: 1.39
8: 1.73 
10: 1.42
13: 1.36

Calcium Phosphate Product:
1: 2.21 x 0.97 = 2.14
5: 2.1 x 1.39 = 2.92
8: 2.05 x 1.73 = 3.55
10: 2.16 x 1.42 = 3.07  
13: 2.14 x 1.36 = 2.91
14: 2.14 x (no phosphate value)

1. The Calcium Phosphate Product shows an upward trend from visit 1 to visit 10, with the highest value of 3.55 at visit 8.

2. Trending the Product against individual values:
- Serum Calcium shows a relatively stable trend between 2.05-2.21 mmol/L
- Phosphate (Pre Dialysis) shows an increasing trend from 0.97 to 1.73 mmol/L between visits 1-8, then a slight decrease.

The upward trend in the Calcium Phosphate Product is primarily driven by the increasing Phosphate levels, while Serum Calcium remained relatively stable during this period.
