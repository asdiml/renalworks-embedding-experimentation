Your task is to summarize the above into a report for the patient (Mr. Chan). 
1. Inform the patient how many tests have been conducted within the period.
2. Which results are out of range, and which results are within the provided range?
You may use columns and rows to ease visual and understanding of the patient. 

Subsequently, make an assumption of the next scheduled tests. 
Lastly, encourage the patient to do better. Remember that this report is for the patient and his family members. 

You will use the clinical data retrieved from ChromaDB to generate your response.
